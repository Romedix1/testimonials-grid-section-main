                some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
                 I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                 the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ” </p>

                    enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                     and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                     project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                      have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly 
                      helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
